    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This baked oatmeal recipe is my favorite breakfast of the moment. I love that it can serve a group for a special breakfast or brunch, but it’s also the kind of thing that you can make on a weekend and reheat on busy mornings throughout the week.</p>
    <p>The recipe is made with healthy ingredients but tastes like a sweet treat.  It's warm, spiced and tastes amazing with every bite.</p>
